In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with Mary and Chr@@ is K@@ an@@ a@@ i@@ ya
So@@ on after , our first daughter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Steph@@ any .
We would also go ca@@ mp@@ ing with them and would have very enjoy@@ able conversa@@ tions around the ca@@ mp@@ fire .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were sho@@ cked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .

In 195@@ 1 , I filled out an app@@ li@@ cation to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead .
While there , I received my invitation to the 2@@ 2@@ nd class of Gilead .
I then traveled by train to South L@@ ans@@ ing , New York , where the school was lo@@ cated .
With Jan@@ et on one of the many is@@ lands in the Philippines
We still serve at the branch office in Que@@ z@@ on City
How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to re@@ duce anxiety ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psalmist David beg@@ ged Jehovah : “ L@@ ist@@ en to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anxious , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ N@@ ever be anxious ” ?
( See the box “ Some P@@ r@@ acti@@ cal W@@ a@@ ys to Re@@ duce An@@ x@@ iety . ” )
How can the meaning of God’s name strengthen your faith ?
His very name is understood to mean “ He Ca@@ uses to Be@@ come . ”
“ An@@ x@@ iety in a man@@ ’s heart we@@ igh@@ s it down , but a good word che@@ ers it up . ”
Why can you be confident that your relationship with God will strengthen you ?
( a ) How can we th@@ row our anxiety on God ?
How can we be sure that Jehovah rewar@@ ds his servants ?
How did Jehovah bless his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith conne@@ cted ?
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewar@@ ded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ mon on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your reward is great in the heaven@@ s , for in that way they persecu@@ ted the prophe@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to posse@@ ss as an inher@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ c@@ tly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and care@@ fully observe all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one Eph@@ ra@@ im , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruit@@ ful in the land of my a@@ ff@@ li@@ ction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he en@@ du@@ red a tor@@ ture st@@ ake , de@@ sp@@ is@@ ing shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sancti@@ fy God’s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the low@@ ly is l@@ ending to Jehovah , and He will rep@@ ay him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewar@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehovah’s servants feel about the rewar@@ ds they receive ?
For example , Bi@@ an@@ ca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my wor@@ ries and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and ble@@ ak .
But as I work clo@@ sely with Jehovah , I feel se@@ cure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundre@@ d@@ fo@@ ld in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that I can con@@ sul@@ t from time to time .
I call it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val No@@ te@@ book . ’
D@@ is@@ coura@@ gement is tem@@ por@@ ary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has rewar@@ ded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?
( Read Romans 6 : 1 , 2 . )
What choice does each of us have to make ?
He wrote : “ I am fleshly , so@@ ld under sin .
( Read Romans 7 : 21 - 23 . )
( Read Proverbs 14 : 5 ; Ephesians 4 : 25 . )
They receive “ the spirit ” as ones “ waiting for a@@ do@@ p@@ tion as sons , the release from [ their fleshly ] bo@@ dies . ”
( Read Romans 4 : 20 - 22 . )
( Read Acts 18 : 2 - 4 ; 20 : 20 , 21 , 34 , 35 . )
Many tou@@ ri@@ sts come to the city of A@@ ve@@ ir@@ o in nor@@ thern Por@@ tu@@ gal to see the interest@@ ing sal@@ t e@@ va@@ por@@ ation p@@ on@@ ds .
Lo@@ cal Witnesses make sure to offer the good news to those who sell the lo@@ cally produced sal@@ t
In this article , we will learn how to treasure God’s gift of free will by using it in a way that pleas@@ es the Gi@@ ver of that gift .
The first article explains what modesty is and what it is not .
How does Jehovah expect us to use our abilities ?
Clearly , Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others .
Noah lived in a world that was “ filled with violence ” and immorality .
O@@ pp@@ o@@ sition to our preaching ( See paragraphs 6 - 9 )
6 , 7 . ( a ) What could Noah not do ?
( b ) How are we in a situation similar to No@@ ah’s ?
We too live in a world filled with wi@@ c@@ kedness , which we know Jehovah has promised to destroy .
In the mean@@ time , we cannot force people to accept the “ good news of the Kingdom . ”
What Noah could do : Instead of giving up because of what he could not do , Noah focused on what he could do .
When that happened , how did David react ?
Pa@@ st sins ( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sin@@ ned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not un@@ do what he had done .
He had to trust that when he truly rep@@ en@@ ted , Jehovah would forgive him and help him endure the consequences of his actions .
( Read James 5 : 14 - 16 . )
He had to leave the matter in Jehovah’s hands .
( Read Luke 21 : 1 - 4 . )
Consider a brother named Mal@@ col@@ m , who remained faithful until his death in 2015 .
F@@ oc@@ us on what you can do , not on what you cannot do . ”
( b ) How will you apply the 20@@ 17 y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext in your life ?
Our y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext for 20@@ 17 : “ Tru@@ st in Jehovah and do what is good . ” ​ — Psalm 37 : 3
How can we show respect for the decisions of others ?
I will love them of my own free will . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) Who was the first to receive God’s gift of free will , and how did he use it ?
( b ) What question must each of us ask ?
The answer to that question can determine our everlasting future .
God “ began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one . ”
What must we never do with our gift of free will ?
Imagine that you gave a valuable gift to a friend .
What is one way we can avoid mi@@ su@@ sing our Christian freedom ?
( Read 1 Peter 2 : 16 . )
It does not bel@@ ong to man who is walking even to direct his st@@ ep . ”
What do we learn from the principle found at G@@ al@@ a@@ ti@@ ans 6 : 5 ?
Remember the principle found at G@@ al@@ a@@ ti@@ ans 6 : 5 .
How will you show that you treasure your gift of free will ?
( a ) What do many people think about modesty ?
What is modesty , and what is it not ?
Why should we avoid jud@@ ging other pe@@ op@@ le@@ ’s mo@@ tives ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ example when we receive a change of assignment ?
( Read G@@ al@@ a@@ ti@@ ans 6 : 4 , 5 . )
( Read Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 . )
( Read Ec@@ cle@@ si@@ a@@ st@@ es 11 : 4 - 6 . )
What will help us to remain modest forever ?
Why is it difficult for some to d@@ ele@@ g@@ ate authority ?
He told Nathan to tell David : “ You are not the one who will build the house for me to d@@ well in . ”
( Read N@@ u@@ mb@@ ers 11 : 24 - 29 . )
No , I wish that all of Jehovah’s people were prophe@@ ts and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them ! ”
( Read Philippians 2 : 20 - 22 . )
The branch office sent us 8@@ 00 magaz@@ ines to use in the ministry .
I taught cla@@ sses in M@@ an@@ a@@ us , B@@ el@@ é@@ m , F@@ or@@ tal@@ e@@ z@@ a , Re@@ ci@@ fe , and S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
We arrived in Li@@ s@@ b@@ on , Por@@ tu@@ gal , in Au@@ g@@ ust of 196@@ 4 .
It is the only one doing the work Jesus comman@@ ded his disciples to do ​ — preach the good news of God’s Kingdom ! ”
While this article was being prepared for publi@@ cation , D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as Gu@@ est died faithful to Jehovah on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 25 , 2015 .
( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 11 - 14 . )
And “ the spirit of Jehovah began to em@@ power David . ”
Why did God want his people to respect the leaders in Israel ?
( Read Hebrews 1 : 7 , 14 . )
The Bible ref@@ ers to the Law given to Israel as “ the Law of Moses . ”
11 , 12 . ( a ) What were Joshua and the kings who ru@@ led God’s people required to do ?
“ As soon as the king heard the words of the book of the Law , he ri@@ pped his gar@@ ments a@@ part . ”
Why did Jehovah discipline some of the leaders of his people ?
In some cases , Jehovah discipl@@ ined or re@@ placed those leaders .
What proved that Jesus was em@@ power@@ ed by holy spirit ?
S@@ hor@@ tly after Jesus was baptized , “ angels came and began to minist@@ er to him . ”
H@@ ours before his death , “ an angel from heaven appe@@ a@@ red to him and strengthened him . ”
How did God’s Word guide Jesus ’ life and teaching ?
It is in va@@ in that they keep worshipp@@ ing me , for they teach comm@@ ands of men as do@@ ct@@ r@@ ines . ”
No@@ body is good ex@@ ce@@ pt one , God . ”
“ In@@ stan@@ tly the angel of Jehovah stru@@ ck him , because he did not give the glory to God , and he was e@@ at@@ en up with wor@@ ms and died . ”
What will we discuss in the next article ?
The next article will consider the answers to those questions .
This may have been the original do@@ cu@@ ment written by Moses .
Why was this sele@@ ction so important to them and to Jehovah ?
As a governing body , they gave direction to all the congregations . ​ — Acts 15 : 2 .
5 , 6 . ( a ) How did holy spirit em@@ power the governing body ?
( c ) How did God’s Word guide the governing body ?
First , holy spirit em@@ power@@ ed the governing body .
Th@@ ird , God’s Word gui@@ ded the governing body .
Why can we say that Jesus led the early Christians ?
( a ) When did Jesus app@@ oin@@ t “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” ?
In 1919 , three years after Brother Rus@@ sel@@ l@@ ’s death , Jesus appointed “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave . ”
The July 15 , 20@@ 13 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Governing Body .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the Governing Body ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 . )
( Read Revelation 14 : 6 , 7 . )
What is one way to remember the Governing Body ?
Why are you determined to follow our Lea@@ der , Jesus ?
When Jesus returned to heaven , he did not ab@@ an@@ don his followers .
So@@ on , he will lead us to everlasting life .
Since 195@@ 5 , that cor@@ por@@ ation has been known as the Watch Tower Bible and T@@ r@@ act Society of Pen@@ n@@ s@@ yl@@ v@@ ani@@ a .
Jehovah “ com@@ forts us in all our trials ”
“ I have spoken , and I will bring it about .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What has Jehovah reve@@ aled to us ?
THE very first words of the Bible make this simple but pro@@ found stat@@ ement : “ In the beginning God created the heaven@@ s and the earth . ”
( c ) What questions will we consider ?
And why is Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice the key that un@@ lo@@ c@@ ks the door for God’s purpose to be accomp@@ lished ?
What are some gifts that Jehovah gave Adam and Eve ?
But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die . ”
It was as if he were saying : ‘ You mean you cannot do what you want ? ’
But Jehovah is faithful to his own standards ; he never viol@@ ates them .
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 4 , 5 . )
Why is the ransom such a precious gift ?
Jehovah provided the ransom at great cost to himself .
When will Jehovah become “ all things to everyone ” ?
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also on earth . ”
( Read Psalm 40 : 8 - 10 . )
How can we show that we love Jehovah’s name ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )
Why can Jehovah view us as righteous , even though we are imperfect ?
He accep@@ ts as his worshippers those who dedi@@ cate themselves to him .
What did Jesus mean when he next said : “ Let your will take place ” ?
How does the ransom benefit humans who have died ?
What is God’s will for the “ great crow@@ d ” ?
( a ) What blessings do we now receive from Jehovah ?
( Read Acts 3 : 19 - 21 . )
“ We have come to know and believe the love that God has for us .
And should we at times change a decision that we have made ?
This article will help us to answer those questions .
Yet , Jehovah viewed those kings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
We lived on a small farm in ea@@ st@@ ern South Da@@ k@@ o@@ t@@ a .
F@@ ar@@ ming was an important part of our fam@@ il@@ y’s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 19@@ 34 .
My d@@ ad , C@@ la@@ ren@@ ce , and later my un@@ c@@ le Al@@ fre@@ d , served as comp@@ any servant ( now called co@@ ord@@ in@@ ator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Con@@ de , South Da@@ k@@ o@@ t@@ a .
My sister , D@@ or@@ o@@ thy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were six .
Con@@ ven@@ tions and as@@ semb@@ lies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who suppor@@ ted my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations ne@@ ar@@ by , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Be@@ thel@@ ite , with a farm tru@@ ck
The farm on St@@ at@@ en Is@@ land included the ra@@ di@@ o st@@ ation W@@ B@@ B@@ R .
On@@ ly 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assigned to the farm .
Most of us were young and quite in@@ experienced .
Brother Peter@@ son did his work at Bethel well but never ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted the field ministry .
With Ang@@ el@@ a in 197@@ 5 , before a tel@@ evi@@ sion inter@@ view
Th@@ re@@ e years later , we were invited to Bethel .
Why do Jehovah and Christ de@@ serve to be hon@@ o@@ red ?
H@@ u@@ mans were created “ in God’s i@@ mage . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How do Jehovah’s Witnesses view government offici@@ als ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 17 . )
Moreover , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your Father , the heavenly One .
Ne@@ ither be called leaders , for your Lea@@ der is one , the Christ .
But the greatest one among you must be your minist@@ er .
W@@ ho@@ ever ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be humb@@ led , and who@@ ever humb@@ les himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted . ”
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
Why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) To make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
( Read James 1 : 5 - 8 . )
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
Lo@@ ving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
Elders too should take time to do research .
Will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?
What does it mean to serve Jehovah with a complete heart ?
Which of the four kings would you like to imitate , and why ?
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 14 : 11 . )
What would your heart move you to do ?
A@@ sa@@ ’s son Jehoshaphat “ kept walking in the way of his father Asa . ”
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 20 : 2 - 4 . )
( Read Isaiah 37 : 15 - 20 . )
( Read 2 K@@ ings 20 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 34 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 34 : 18 , 19 . )
( b ) What will we discuss in the next article ?
Why will we consider the examples of four kings of Judah ?
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 32 : 31 . )
Many praise him for what he has done .
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that Ne@@ cho@@ ’s words were “ from the mouth of God . ”
Let us meditate on these Bible accounts and be than@@ k@@ ful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
How many vo@@ ws have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be te@@ sted .
“ The world is pa@@ ssing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God re@@ main@@ s forever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corru@@ pt organiz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pa@@ ssing away . ”
There is no d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness or deep sha@@ do@@ w where wrong@@ do@@ ers can con@@ c@@ eal themselves . ”
Later in the same p@@ salm , we read : “ The righteous will posse@@ ss the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the mee@@ k ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organized ?
After Armageddon , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organized .
What kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family affected ?
What do we learn from Jehovah’s judgment of S@@ od@@ om and Go@@ mor@@ ra@@ h ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( Read Psalm 46 : 8 , 9 . )
What are some things that will be g@@ one forever after Armageddon ?
I@@ l@@ lu@@ strate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is g@@ one ?
“ W@@ I@@ L@@ L the Jud@@ ge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
Christians expect to experience some injustice outside the Christian congregation .
In 194@@ 6 , he atten@@ ded the e@@ igh@@ th class of Gilead School in New York , U.@@ S@@ .@@ A .
After gradu@@ ation , he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Ab@@ raha@@ m@@ ’s great - grand@@ son Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What in@@ justi@@ ces did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Lo@@ y@@ alty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .
Most important , he did not allow the im@@ perfe@@ ctions and wrong actions of others to separate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Jud@@ ge of all the earth ” ?
What will we consider in the next article ?
See W@@ ill@@ i D@@ ie@@ h@@ l@@ ’s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will Tru@@ st , ” in the November 1 , 199@@ 1 , issue of The Watchtower .
( See opening pic@@ tu@@ res . ) ( b ) What questions will be answered in this article ?
They are exc@@ el@@ l@@ ent examples for men and women today who choose to make vo@@ ws to Jehovah .
How serious is it to make a vow to God ?
What lessons can we learn from Jephthah and Hannah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) What is a vow ?
( b ) What do the Scriptures say about making vo@@ ws to God ?
He should do everything he vo@@ wed he would do . ”
( a ) How serious is it to make a vow to God ?
( b ) What do we want to learn about Jephthah and Hannah ?
( a ) How easy was it for Jephthah and his daughter to pay his vow to God ?
Jephthah said : “ I have opened my mouth to Jehovah , and I am un@@ able to turn back . ”
( b ) What did H@@ an@@ na@@ h’s vow mean for Samuel ?
She took Samuel to High Pri@@ est El@@ i at the tabernacle in S@@ hi@@ lo@@ h and said : “ It was for this boy that I prayed , and Jehovah gran@@ ted my pe@@ ti@@ tion that I asked of him .
The second most important vow that a person can make is the marriage vow .
What does the Bible say about div@@ or@@ ce and separ@@ ation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
One couple said : “ Since we have been stud@@ ying this brochure , our marriage has been happ@@ i@@ er than ever . ”
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
S@@ pe@@ cial full - time service vow ( See paragraph 19 )
It is not the people but their assign@@ ments that are viewed as special .
See the App@@ en@@ di@@ x article “ The Bi@@ ble@@ ʼ@@ s V@@ i@@ ew on Di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and Se@@ par@@ ation ” in the book “ Keep Y@@ ourselves in God@@ ʼ@@ s Love . ”
Does the Al@@ mighty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity ? ”
( b ) How did Israel de@@ fe@@ at J@@ ab@@ in@@ ’s army ?
( Read Judges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
The tor@@ ren@@ t of K@@ i@@ sho@@ n wa@@ shed them away . ”
See the article “ An@@ x@@ iety About M@@ on@@ ey ” in the July 1 , 2015 , issue of The Watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What injustice did Naboth and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was Naboth , and why did he ref@@ use to sell his v@@ in@@ ey@@ ard to King Ahab ?
Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Que@@ en Je@@ ze@@ bel .
Read 1 K@@ ings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respect@@ fully explained : “ It is un@@ th@@ in@@ k@@ able , from Jehovah’s stand@@ point , for me to give you the inher@@ it@@ ance of my fore@@ fa@@ thers . ”
Why would humility have been a protection to Nabo@@ th@@ ’s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders ann@@ oun@@ ce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter cor@@ rected , and what questions arise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .
3 Hel@@ ping “ F@@ o@@ re@@ ign Re@@ si@@ dents ” to “ Ser@@ ve Jehovah With Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ”
The second article consi@@ ders how app@@ lying Bible principles will help im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people ru@@ n@@ ning , sho@@ o@@ ting .
My parents and 11 of us si@@ bl@@ ings f@@ led for our lives with only the clo@@ th@@ es on our bac@@ ks .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecu@@ te you in one city , fle@@ e to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
My fe@@ et were so s@@ wo@@ l@@ l@@ en that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to ab@@ an@@ don me to the re@@ bel for@@ ces — ​ car@@ ried me .
They go@@ ssi@@ p@@ ed , d@@ ran@@ k , g@@ am@@ b@@ led , sto@@ le , and were immor@@ al . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gra@@ titude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( a ) What temp@@ tation do refugees need to re@@ sist ?
Fin@@ ally , he held up the emp@@ ty ba@@ g and said with a smile : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of t@@ od@@ a@@ y’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is re@@ stri@@ cted .
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close relatives , provi@@ ding food , clo@@ th@@ es , s@@ hel@@ ter , and tran@@ sp@@ or@@ tation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arri@@ ves , elders should follow the direction in O@@ r@@ ganiz@@ ed to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask dis@@ cre@@ et questions about a refu@@ ge@@ e@@ ’s congregation and ministry to discer@@ n his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family hea@@ ds decide which language congregation the family will attend ?
How can others help im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What problem do many im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ f@@ er the local language .
Wi@@ th@@ in a few years , the shi@@ ft was complete .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t understand the meetings , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’t identi@@ fy with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their daily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Pa@@ ren@@ ts , if that descri@@ bes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ tes best in another spoken language de@@ serves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we personally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we regularly atten@@ ded meetings and sha@@ red in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for me@@ als and ex@@ cur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Fri@@ end .
We considered this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also atten@@ ded meetings in our language .
Life was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the ba@@ si@@ cs of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ alls K@@ ri@@ st@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I atten@@ ded a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Another tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Young people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ wit@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ a@@ den@@ ed our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their chil@@ dre@@ n’s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the le@@ i@@ sure activities we sha@@ red in as a group . ”
Pa@@ ren@@ ts , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 15 : 7 . )
P@@ ut your chil@@ d’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .
But it w@@ as@@ n@@ ’t until 194@@ 6 that I really understood Bible truth .
E@@ ven@@ tually , I learned sign language and had fu@@ n pla@@ ying with the other children .
She accepted a magazine sub@@ s@@ crip@@ tion and wanted me to meet her husband , G@@ ary .
E@@ ven@@ tually , five from their class became Jehovah’s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a pi@@ e@@ ce of can@@ dy and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Be@@ come one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our we@@ d@@ ding .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affection for our brothers ?
What may have ca@@ used the love of some Christians to grow cold ?
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first command@@ ment . ”
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 9@@ 7 - 100 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragraph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 The@@ ss@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ Ca@@ st the n@@ et on the right side of the boat and you will find some . ’
So they ca@@ st it , but they were not able to ha@@ ul it in because of the large number of fish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I finally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After plan@@ ning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a stre@@ et ven@@ d@@ or and sell ice cre@@ am .
In the beginning , I strugg@@ led fin@@ anci@@ ally and got discoura@@ ged .
When I met my former wor@@ k@@ mates , they would lau@@ gh at me and ask why I thought sel@@ ling ice cre@@ am was better than working with com@@ pu@@ ters in an a@@ ir - con@@ di@@ tioned en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
I prayed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with my cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers ’ ta@@ st@@ es and became more sk@@ ill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I worked with com@@ pu@@ ters .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the stre@@ ss and worry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursu@@ ing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two ma@@ st@@ ers . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Ri@@ ches . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your Re@@ creation B@@ ene@@ fi@@ cial ? ”
We also sha@@ red regularly in the field ministry . ”
We were so sa@@ d to leave our Bible students behind . ”

What a joy to be able to stay in our assignment ! ”
They trusted in the promise found at Psalm 37 : 5 : “ Com@@ mit your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf . ”
Today we do , and we lack nothing of real importance . ”
Why can we expect that marriage and family life will invol@@ ve some trials ?
We can be sure that he wants the best for us , as he did for his servants in the past . ​ — Read Jeremiah 29 : 11 , 12 .
( Read 1 Samuel 1 : 4 - 7 . )
“ Even though An@@ n was not related to me , I found her loving concern to be such a help , ” Paul@@ a explains .
“ It helped me to keep serving Jehovah . ”
( Read Psalm 14@@ 5 : 18 , 19 . )
“ Where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ K@@ E 12 : 34 .
As we do so , meditate on how you personally can deep@@ en your love for these spiritual trea@@ sures .
Can you imagine how precious that pe@@ ar@@ l was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul descri@@ be our ministry as a “ treasure in ear@@ then ve@@ s@@ sel@@ s ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Be@@ thel@@ ites , pioneers , and elders .
I@@ ren@@ e says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pursu@@ ed , I can@@ ’t imagine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ treasure st@@ ore ” that Jesus refer@@ red to at Matthew 13 : 52 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the ra@@ b@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and che@@ cked the Watchtower and Awake !
magaz@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous months , I found an article expla@@ ining that Daniel was written in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ treasure in the heaven@@ s , where no thief ge@@ ts near and no mo@@ th con@@ su@@ mes .
For where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .
On@@ ce when we were y@@ el@@ ling at each other , two people came in and witne@@ ssed our b@@ low@@ up . ” ​ — C@@ H@@ R@@ I@@ S .
“ A sister with whom I often preached su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ended our arrang@@ e@@ ments for the ministry .
I had no i@@ dea why . ” ​ — J@@ A@@ N@@ E@@ T .
“ I was on a three - person phone call .
One of the others said good - b@@ y@@ e , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said un@@ kind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hun@@ g up . ” ​ — M@@ I@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ E@@ L .
“ In our congregation , two pioneers began having problems .
Their b@@ ic@@ k@@ ering was discoura@@ ging to others . ” ​ — G@@ A@@ R@@ Y .
“ Do not become up@@ set with one another on the way . ”
“ Pl@@ ans fail when there is no con@@ sul@@ tation . ”
Mic@@ hael says , “ My brother genu@@ in@@ ely for@@ gave me . ”
“ Con@@ tin@@ ue putting up with one another and for@@ giving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for com@@ pla@@ int against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That differ@@ ence may seem un@@ important ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my ir@@ rit@@ ation grew , I started being cur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I de@@ serve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own personality f@@ laws , and I was very disapp@@ ointed in myself .
I realized that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I b@@ ou@@ ght the sister a small gift and wrote her a c@@ ard to a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for my bad attitude .
We hu@@ g@@ ged each other and a@@ gre@@ ed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
F@@ OR many people today , money is the big issue .
Why must the issue of sovereignty be sett@@ led ?
How important is the v@@ indi@@ cation of Jehovah’s sovereignty ?
Why , from the day our fore@@ fa@@ thers f@@ ell as@@ le@@ ep in death , all things are continu@@ ing ex@@ ac@@ tly as they were from c@@ rea@@ tion@@ ’s beginning . ”
( Read Isaiah 55 : 10 , 11 . )
( Read Job 1 : 7 - 12 . )
( Read Job 38 : 18 - 21 . )
( Read Romans 5 : 3 - 5 . )
One reason is that he ru@@ les with love .
He ca@@ res for us better than we can care for ourselves .
How can elders and family hea@@ ds imitate Jehovah ?
Publi@@ shed by Jehovah’s Witnesses but now out of print .
Psalm 147 repe@@ ate@@ dly encoura@@ ges God’s people to praise Jehovah .
What was it about Jehovah that impre@@ ssed the psalmist so much that he wanted God to be pra@@ is@@ ed ?
Many young brothers and sisters are ze@@ al@@ ously enter@@ ing the full - time service .
“ Make friends for y@@ ourselves by means of the un@@ righteous riches . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ K@@ E 16 : 9 .
How can we avoid becoming sla@@ ves of t@@ od@@ a@@ y’s comm@@ erci@@ al world ?
In this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ counsel ?
How do we know that t@@ od@@ a@@ y’s comm@@ erci@@ al system was not part of God’s purpose ?
Give examples of how some are showing faith@@ fulness in their use of un@@ righteous riches .
I am more gener@@ ous in being for@@ giving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disapp@@ oin@@ t@@ ments and counsel . ”
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
How did Abraham show that he trusted in God ?
( b ) How can we apply Paul’s counsel today ?
After c@@ all@@ ing Timothy “ a fine soldier of Christ Jesus , ” Paul told him : “ No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the comm@@ erci@@ al bus@@ in@@ e@@ sses of life , in order to gain the approval of the one who en@@ ro@@ lled him as a soldier . ”
Jehovah ble@@ sses those who are “ rich in fine works . ”

Every single time , the peace of God truly gu@@ ar@@ ded our hearts and minds . ” ​ — Read Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
How did Jesus show em@@ pa@@ thy when La@@ zar@@ us died ?
If you are gri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ o@@ thing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
( Read 1 The@@ ss@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does express how he fe@@ els , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that mo@@ ment , I don@@ ’t feel quite so alone in my gri@@ ef . ”
“ Re@@ cei@@ ving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those expre@@ ssions make me feel loved and ca@@ red for . ”
“ Sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” rec@@ alls D@@ al@@ en@@ e , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
They start praying , often batt@@ ling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sen@@ ten@@ ces , their voice ge@@ ts str@@ ong@@ er and they say the most heartfelt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strength@@ ening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distre@@ ss . ”
“ I expected my first we@@ d@@ ding ann@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ary to be very tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
But a few brothers and sisters plan@@ ned a small ga@@ ther@@ ing of my clo@@ se@@ st friends so that I w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t be on my own . ”
“ O@@ f@@ ten the help and compani@@ on@@ ship offered when there is no special ann@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ary can be very bene@@ fi@@ cial , ” explains J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous mo@@ ments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving ar@@ ms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the So@@ vere@@ ign Lord Jehovah will wi@@ pe away the t@@ ears from all fac@@ es . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comfor@@ ting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 1@@ 21 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 ; 6@@ 6 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

“ Jehovah fin@@ ds plea@@ sure in those who fear him , in those waiting for his loyal love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) How might we at times feel about our trials , but how does Jehovah use his Word to help us ?
Today , Jehovah gui@@ des us with his Word , the Bible .

What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will pro@@ b@@ ably agree that before star@@ ting a jour@@ ney , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a jour@@ ney , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his i@@ mage . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also dre@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ Pl@@ ans fail when there is no con@@ sul@@ tation , but there is accomp@@ li@@ shment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any care@@ er , you need time to become sk@@ illed .
At first , I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t start any Bible stu@@ dies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several stu@@ dies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from N@@ or@@ th A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a , wr@@ ites : “ When I was seven , many of my cla@@ ss@@ mates were V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the English and V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam@@ ese e@@ ditions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I atten@@ ded the Bible School for S@@ ing@@ le Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam@@ ese people are a@@ ma@@ zed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progre@@ ssed to baptism . ” ​ — Co@@ mp@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I atten@@ ded the Bible School for S@@ ing@@ le Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
I@@ t@@ ’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progre@@ ssed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time some@@ day .
Fin@@ ally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I suppor@@ ted myself working part - time for a brother who was a buil@@ der .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ o@@ f@@ s , w@@ in@@ do@@ ws , and do@@ ors .
Later , I spent two years with a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e reli@@ ef te@@ am , re@@ building Kingdom H@@ alls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
H@@ ere in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall pro@@ ject to another every few weeks .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
The pl@@ ans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not fore@@ see . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to oper@@ ate prin@@ ting pre@@ sses and later to do com@@ pu@@ ter progra@@ m@@ ming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then plan to do what is pleas@@ ing to him .
He has studied human beha@@ vior since man was created .
I@@ t@@ ’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into disa@@ ster ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be stru@@ ck with ter@@ r@@ or or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wh@@ er@@ ever you go . ”
L@@ ist@@ en to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ li@@ ghts how Jehovah can do the u@@ nex@@ pe@@ cted by accomp@@ li@@ shing things we could never imagine .
Like the far@@ mer , we need to wait patiently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mi@@ ca@@ h ?
( Read Mi@@ ca@@ h 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mi@@ ca@@ h , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grand@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imagine Ab@@ raha@@ m@@ ’s joy when he is resur@@ rected back to a paradise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God inten@@ ded it to turn out well and to pre@@ serve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has ri@@ ch@@ ly rewar@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wait patiently ?
What lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arrived in M@@ ace@@ don@@ ia , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
Bo@@ th he and Silas started “ praying and pra@@ is@@ ing God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul’s situation change u@@ nex@@ pe@@ c@@ te@@ dly ?
What will we now discuss and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in harmony with our prayers .
Sometimes he surpri@@ ses us by doing the u@@ nex@@ pe@@ cted .
Jehovah sent an angel to destroy 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ er@@ i@@ b@@ ’s soldiers in one night .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehovah’s actions ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ded all of Jose@@ p@@ h’s expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions .
Think , too , about Jose@@ p@@ h’s great - grand@@ mother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah ca@@ res for us and wants us to succeed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old personality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion ca@@ mp@@ s ] . ”
And you people have clean@@ ed the sta@@ di@@ um so n@@ ic@@ ely .
But most of all , you are truly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ rac@@ ial . ”
What will be considered in this article , and why ?
But the more I had sexual rela@@ tions , the more in@@ se@@ cure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sa@@ k@@ ur@@ a was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wait for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could watch por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic vide@@ o@@ s . ”
What helped Steph@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ u@@ sive speech ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally .
Today , Steph@@ en serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sinful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
What will be discu@@ ssed in the next article ?
Some of the n@@ ames in this article have been changed .
See chapter 25 in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — An@@ s@@ wers That Work , V@@ o@@ lu@@ me 1 .
( Read Colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )
He stated : “ There is neither Greek nor Jew , circum@@ ci@@ sion nor un@@ circum@@ ci@@ sion , fore@@ ign@@ er , S@@ c@@ y@@ thi@@ an , slave , or fre@@ e@@ man . ”
( a ) How do servants of Jehovah need to treat others ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What have been the results ?
Then he atten@@ ded a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
You get to experience our worldwide bro@@ ther@@ hood and see its mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous unity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them scriptures from their Por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they pa@@ id attention and sometimes even shed t@@ ears . ”
We are so than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in showing mildness and patience ?
Then he added : “ If you continue showing fav@@ ori@@ ti@@ sm , you are commit@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in deal@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refle@@ cting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my co@@ worker had been cop@@ ing with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stre@@ ss .
I conclu@@ ded that she pro@@ b@@ ably did not really mean what she wrote .
Re@@ fle@@ cting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when pro@@ vo@@ ked helped me to show similar love to my co@@ worker . ”
By lea@@ ving heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ Pu@@ tting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peace@@ ful spirit is truly uni@@ qu@@ e in t@@ od@@ a@@ y’s divi@@ ded world ?
Paul wrote : “ Love buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gro@@ wn the ven@@ ue . ”
B@@ el@@ o@@ w the picture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ va@@ sion of the stre@@ e@@ ts . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only line that pa@@ sses near this place is a tel@@ e@@ gra@@ ph line . ”
In Mexico , 2@@ ,@@ 2@@ 6@@ 2@@ ,@@ 6@@ 46 people atten@@ ded the Memorial in 20@@ 16 .

Pra@@ y for wisdom to say or do the right thing .
How can you prepare yourself to re@@ sist temp@@ ta@@ tions ?
What experience did one brother have , and why are our re@@ actions in similar situations important ?
In what ways can parents help their children to develop self - control ?

I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .

“ A few days later , I read a s@@ crip@@ ture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is quo@@ ted as saying : ‘ Co@@ me , now , you people , and let us set matters stra@@ ight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as s@@ car@@ let , they will be made white just like s@@ now . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Co@@ me on , V@@ ic@@ k@@ y , le@@ t@@ ’s set matters stra@@ ight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was un@@ able to sleep that night .

All of a su@@ d@@ den , it da@@ w@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .

Your S@@ on@@ ’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been thro@@ wing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

However , if we talk with ea@@ se and as@@ surance about what we believe , making it a normal part of conversation , it@@ ’s more likely that they will respect us . ”

( 3 ) How will our effort to have “ the mind of Christ ” help us to be spiritual people ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )
What does the Bible say about spiritually - minded people ?
What can we learn from the example of Jacob ?
What can we learn from the example of Mary ?
( Read Luke 1 : 46 - 55 . )
( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
Rachel , a sister in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , says : “ I loved to follow the worl@@ d’s fa@@ shi@@ ons .
As a result , I did not dress very mo@@ dest@@ ly .
But learning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .
Ma@@ king changes was not easy , but I became happ@@ i@@ er and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are wit@@ nesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your daily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the mo@@ tions .
I loo@@ ked spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to myself , ‘ If I am going to be my wi@@ fe@@ ’s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”
He says : “ I studied the Bible and studied and studied some more , and the pi@@ e@@ ces started to fit together .
I got understanding and , most important , develop@@ ed a close relationship with Jehovah . ”

He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little gir@@ l@@ ’s decision to dedi@@ cate her life to H@@ im . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pressure anyone to get baptized ?
What questions will we consider in the next article ?
If you are a parent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you rep@@ en@@ ted of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hospit@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He wr@@ ites : “ I he@@ sit@@ ated initi@@ ally because we were new@@ ly married and living in a small house .
But having students stay with us was truly a joy@@ ous experience .
As new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was par@@ tic@@ ularly ho@@ me@@ sick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p@@ .@@ m . , we heard a kno@@ ck on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three or@@ ang@@ es .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
We invited her in and gave her a gla@@ ss of water .
If you feel anxious about having gu@@ ests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain ad@@ m@@ its : “ There can be a measure of n@@ er@@ v@@ ousness in pre@@ par@@ ing for gu@@ ests .
But as with anything in rela@@ tion to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far ou@@ twe@@ igh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sit@@ ting down with gu@@ ests over co@@ ffe@@ e and tal@@ king . ”
Another elder wr@@ ites : “ Ha@@ ving friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instru@@ ctors really put me at ea@@ se .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent sta@@ ying with a spiritual person who may not have much materi@@ ally but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This re@@ minded me of what my m@@ um used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dis@@ h of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les where ther@@ e@@ ’s love . ’ ”
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Ho@@ sts usu@@ ally prepare well for their gu@@ ests ( See paragraph 20 )

( Read Titus 2 : 11 - 14 . )
The elder re@@ called : “ G@@ raham had a problem with pride .
He was cri@@ tical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellow@@ shipp@@ ing .
So for the next few stu@@ dies , we discu@@ ssed scriptures on pride and its effe@@ cts .
G@@ raham began to see himself clearly in the mir@@ r@@ or of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowled@@ ging that he had been bl@@ in@@ ded by a ‘ ra@@ fter ’ of pride and that his cri@@ tical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earne@@ stly , and to make daily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ She@@ pher@@ d the flo@@ ck of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under comp@@ ul@@ sion , but will@@ ingly before God ; not for love of di@@ sh@@ one@@ st gain , but ea@@ g@@ er@@ ly ; not l@@ or@@ ding it over those who are God’s inher@@ it@@ ance , but becoming examples to the flo@@ ck . ”

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obe@@ dience to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was re@@ in@@ stated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or cri@@ tici@@ ze me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Ti@@ me and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ firm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be re@@ sto@@ red to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is c@@ rou@@ ch@@ ing at the door , and its cra@@ ving is to do@@ min@@ ate you ; but will you get the ma@@ st@@ er@@ y over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
People around the world are de@@ man@@ ding more freedom .

Like that pi@@ lot , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?

For you have made me rejoice , O Jehovah , because of your dee@@ ds ; because of the works of your hands I shout joy@@ fully . ”
The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not un@@ righteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .
Proverbs 21 : 5 says : “ The pl@@ ans of the di@@ li@@ gent surely lead to succe@@ ss . ”
The earlier you make pl@@ ans by setting good goals , the so@@ on@@ er you will have succe@@ ss .
With a uni@@ ver@@ sity de@@ gree in law , I could have ear@@ ned a lot of money , but I would have had little chance of fin@@ ding part - time work . ”
17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - room lo@@ g ca@@ b@@ in in a very small town called Li@@ ber@@ ty , In@@ di@@ ana , U.@@ S@@ .@@ A .
Later , my mother gave birth to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
D@@ U@@ R@@ IN@@ G my school years , not much changed .
The town of Li@@ ber@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by small far@@ ms , and the basic cro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ apti@@ st church every S@@ un@@ day .
They wanted me to make the military my care@@ er .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congrega@@ tion Book St@@ ud@@ y , a small meeting for Bible study and dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehovah’s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being opened !
I started pioneering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ lori@@ a was a je@@ w@@ el then , and she is a je@@ w@@ el today .
G@@ lori@@ a and I got married in Fe@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Sim@@ on K@@ ra@@ ker , inter@@ viewed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
Most of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three dol@@ lar@@ s a day .
Each week , G@@ lori@@ a did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I remember one time when we sto@@ pped at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Me@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’s daughter and her husband .
M@@ other and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the white congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that promo@@ tes rac@@ is@@ m and violence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 196@@ 2 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Minist@@ ry School at South L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a tel@@ e@@ phone comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f had inter@@ viewed me for a job .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first black man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to travel to New York .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
H@@ ere is how G@@ lori@@ a re@@ members our time in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f : “ I f@@ ell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible stu@@ dies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
While we were pioneering in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f , we applied to become special pioneers .
Brother Le@@ on W@@ ea@@ ver , now the co@@ ord@@ in@@ ator of the United States B@@ ranch Com@@ mit@@ tee , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about becoming a circuit overseer .
After I was appointed , Brother Tho@@ mp@@ son was the first distri@@ ct overseer I served with .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
I remember saying to G@@ lori@@ a , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a town we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ ne@@ s@@ see .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
G@@ lori@@ a was a je@@ w@@ el when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tran@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity and se@@ cur@@ ity . ”
Second , we must pray for God’s holy spirit .
If the house is de@@ serving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not de@@ serving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I gree@@ ted her in her own t@@ ong@@ ue .
T@@ a@@ ken by surprise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I po@@ lit@@ ely told her that I wi@@ shed to see the High Com@@ mission@@ er .
She tel@@ e@@ ph@@ oned the offici@@ al , who came out to meet me and gree@@ ted me in the local language .
After that , he care@@ fully list@@ ened to me as I explained to him the peace@@ ful activities of the Witnesses . ”
